# Variables

# Variables assign data to the given variable
# In order to assign data to a variable, = is used

age = 28

#the variable is: age
#we assigned the integer 28 to the variable
# now when we use the variable 'age' it'll always be 28 unless we chane it.
#to change a variable, assign it new data lower

age = 30

print(age)

# Python will always recognize the lowest (in terms of on the sheet) data for any variable.
